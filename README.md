# C 

## Why learn C?

- The language is small i.e. the number of features is relatively low.
- Many modern languages are based on it. They inherit some of C's features.
- It's closer to the machine. Using it will give one a deeper understanding of 
hardware. 
- The language is efficient. It is widely used in systems programming.

## Confirm your compiler is working

### MacOS

`cc --version`

## `main()`

Every C program must contain a `main` function.
It is the entry point of every program. 

## pass-by-value

- C is pass-by-value without exception. 
- A function is not able to change the actual parameters value.

You can simulate pass-by-reference by passing a pointer to a value and then
changing the value the pointer is pointing to (not the value of the pointer itself, 
i.e. you could not make the pointer point to a different location within the function)
by dereferencing the pointer. 

## arrays vs pointers

- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-array-and-pointers/

- sizeof(arr): gives number of bytes of `arr`
- sizeof(ptr): always gives same size--size of pointer memory address

- When an array is passed as a parameter to a function it becomes a pointer
  - You cannot get the size of the object anymore!
